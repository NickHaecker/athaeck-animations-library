# LICENSE
These license terms are for the Blender files in this folder and only the Blender
files is this folder. Blender uses GNU GPL v3 so files based on Blender
files must also use GNU GPL v3. I'd never choose this license for any project
I didn't have to. A copy of the license is included in this folder, and it's
titled "COPYING.md"
